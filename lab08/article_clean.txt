keep precious cultivable land meet demand Sun-powered energy Lancelotta sure agrivoltaics right solution He believe farm side business preserve strengthen solar compromise Farmers always take care territory Lancellotta say Still novelty higher installation cost farmer resistance change lack clear legislation long way go agrivoltaics go mainstream Both lemon tree citron tree benefit relative

But entrepreneur dark curly hair wear black-framed glass seem worry miss harvest Market price per kilo threshold decide keep lemon hang buyer change mind It unusual approach agriculture farmer fear loss year work often force sell go rate whatever The reason Lancellotta security able wait market The solar panel head We could easily decide let fruit go waste even though wo 'll try find compromise another source income energy production Lancellotta say Finally farmer regain bargain power Producing renewable energy acre 40ha agrivoltaic farmland around Italy give Lancellottas alternative income agriculture generate enough clean electricity family also improve fruit According entrepreneur cover provide panel reduce citrus water need The fruit larger better colour fewer defect exposure element

graze Installing raise panel cost ground-mounted array benefit farm community keep land could outweigh cost Credit Agostino Petroni Installing raise panel cost ground-mounted array benefit farm community keep land could outweigh cost Credit Agostino Petroni One biggest challenge agrivoltaics convince investor worth extra hassle combine solar array agriculture say Axel Weselek PhD candidate University Hohenheim Germany study agrivoltaics benefit crop potato wheat celeriac In plain financial term often attractive invest simple photovoltaic installation nothing farm Weselek say Because investor care agricultural productivity – investment say Installing array around crop expensive non-standard design cost elevate panel grind The electrical yield also lower fewer panel per unit area let sun reach plant underneath It cost €1m per 2.5 acre sq Italy put agrivoltaic farm accord Lancellotta traditional photovoltaic one The initial investment substantial expect return six seven year According Lancellotta today farmer access kind capital One option partner energy producer profit sell energy pay rent farmer also cultivate crop underneath panel This however easy routine agricultural activity substantially reduce energy production vice versa invasive maintenance work panel damage crop Cooperation good contract key system work Lancellotta say On project Lancellotta partner EF Solare Italia largest owner solar plant Italy The firm own panel top Lancellotta citrus farm Le Greenhouse though Lancellotta family also According Andrea Ghiselli chief executive EF Solare Italia way

Ghiselli say Since cost investor higher believe government write clear agrivoltaic farm guide regulation incentivise protect investor This ongoing project There regulatory framework certain even great
