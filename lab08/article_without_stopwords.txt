The citron Calabria southern Italy almost died extreme weather lack economic value . But growing crop canopy solar panels given fruit new lease life – lessons many climate-stressed crops . O On warm late winter morning , Antonio Lancellotta , 35-year-old farmer , shows around one family 's unorthodox 1.8-acre ( 7,280 square metre ) greenhouse Scalea , southern Italy . Rows lush citron trees ( Citrus medica ) , heavy white flowers fill space . Yet , trees , 12.5ft ( 3.8m ) ground , alternating lines transparent plastic sheets photovoltaic panels roofed field . The Lancellotta family one first Italy experiment `` agrivoltaics '' , crops grown underneath solar panels . `` Look quality citron , '' Lancellotta says , holding large heart-shaped yellow fruit . `` Perfect . '' Over centuries , thanks mild climate , locals corner Italy specialised growing large Liscia Diamante ( translates `` smooth diamond '' ) fruits – weigh 11lb ( 5kg ) – meet demand perfume makers used rind 's essential oils . Jewish priests traveled far away select fruits use prayer seven-day religious festival Sukkot . Every family citron trees : area prospered took name Riviera dei Cedri . However , last 50 years , Liscia Diamante almost went extinct Calabrians migrated elsewhere searching better life , cheaper industrial substitutes replaced essential oils . It made little economic sense stayed behind keep growing fruit . You might also like : The clean energy milestone 2023 Can wool ever sustainable ? A low-carbon concrete could help climate In 2009 , Antonio 's father , Mario , agronomist accountant , stumbled upon agrivoltaics . This concept around since 1980s , agronomist saw exciting investment opportunity . What producing energy could support production local endangered citron , grow well , needed natural artificial shade ? The citron historic fruit south Italy , ritual significance Judaism , also prized perfume ( Credit : Agostino Petroni ) The citron historic fruit south Italy , ritual significance Judaism , also prized perfume ( Credit : Agostino Petroni ) His idea line larger trend . That year , European Union issued directive member states ensure 20 % energy renewable sources 2020 , leading race set solar farms . Some farmers preferred sell rent land renewable energy production companies long-term secure income . While European Union surpassed 20 % goal , globally figure solar still low . According 2021 report International Energy Agency , photovoltaic energy production accounts 3.6 % global electricity generation , though growing fast . According Sylvia Kay , British researcher non-profit research advocacy think tank Transnational Institute , quest renewable energy production past decade triggered trend reallocate land used crop cultivation renewable energy production . `` It set sort competing land uses , '' Kay says . In partnership Via Campesina , International farmers ' organisation , compiled report European land concentration `` green grabbing '' , displacement farmland renewable energy production . In many parts world , development large solar projects agricultural land sidelined local communities , see benefits project face unemployment local agricultural jobs disappear . In recent years , tension agricultural solar land felt US , India China , among solar producers . `` There 's question consent , consultation proper planning procedures , '' Kay says . Still , today , need renewable energy curb effects climate change reach self-sufficiency increasing EU worldwide . Countries Japan , France , Germany , US , Italy looking ways keep precious , cultivable lands meet demand Sun-powered energy . Lancelotta sure agrivoltaics right solution . He believes farming side business preserved strengthened solar , compromised . `` Farmers always taking care territory , '' Lancellotta says . Still , novelty , higher installation costs , farmers ' resistance change , lack clear legislation , long way go agrivoltaics goes mainstream . Both lemon trees citron trees benefitted relative cool shade beneath solar panels ( Credit : Agostino Petroni ) Both lemon trees citron trees benefitted relative cool shade beneath solar panels ( Credit : Agostino Petroni ) Lancellotta walks another 3.7-acre ( 15,000 sq ) greenhouse filled 1,250 lemon trees . As talks fruits pride , I felt hint disappointment . He invited witness lemon harvest , cancelled last minute . I anticipated seeing people work plucking lemons air filled fresh citrus scent . But entrepreneur , dark curly hair wears black-framed glasses , n't seem worried missed harvest . Market prices 40 % €1 ( $ 1.1/£0.9 ) per kilo threshold , decided keep lemons hanging buyers changed minds . It 's unusual approach agriculture , farmers , fearing loss year 's work , often forced sell going rate , whatever . The reason Lancellotta 's security able wait market ? The solar panels heads . `` We could easily decide let fruits go waste , even though wo n't 'll try find compromise another source income energy production , '' Lancellotta says . `` Finally , farmers regain bargaining power . '' Producing renewable energy 100 acres ( 40ha ) agrivoltaic farmland around Italy gives Lancellottas alternative income agriculture generating enough clean electricity 16,000 families , also improves fruits . According entrepreneur , cover provided panels reduces citruses ' water needs 70 % . The fruits larger , better colour fewer defects exposure elements . They also carry higher concentration essential oils rind . Lancellotta notes common misconception shade , crops n't grow well . `` But instead , '' says , pausing lemon tree taking ripe lemon hand big smile . Furthermore , roof protects plants extreme climate events : 2017 , unusual winter frost damaged citron plants region , Lancellottas ' trees survived panels protected . They freely distributed grafts trees growers lost plants , helping protect region 's ancient agricultural tradition . It 's problem far unique citron lemons . Climate change impacting agriculture worldwide , extreme weather events become common . `` Floods , landslides – agriculture already fragile sector point view 's sky . You try protect , '' says Mariangela Lancellotta , also works family firm . She agrivoltaics proponents hope practice could benefit wide range crops pressure . For past 20 years Joshua Pearce , photovoltaic researcher professor Western University Ontario , Canada , studying agrivoltaics protects crops increases yields berries , fruits , grains different kinds vegetables . `` There 's giant race everybody world figure best type photovoltaic arrangement specific crop specific area , '' Pearce says . Pearce points study showing end century , pine trees wo n't able grow regions Canada anymore warming weather . So , 's talking Christmas tree farms trying agrivoltaics protect crop . `` At least , completely non-intuitive could actually get higher yields Christmas trees wheat corn shading little bit , '' Pearce says . Agrivoltaic farming come different shapes forms : Pearce refers elevated solar panels Lancellotta uses `` European model '' , Canada , thanks large availability farmland , panels still mainly positioned directly ground spaced far apart , functioning windbreakers , cultivation sheep grazing . Installing raised panels costs ground-mounted arrays , benefits farming community keeping land could outweigh costs ( Credit : Agostino Petroni ) Installing raised panels costs ground-mounted arrays , benefits farming community keeping land could outweigh costs ( Credit : Agostino Petroni ) One biggest challenges agrivoltaics convincing investors 's worth extra hassle combining solar array agriculture , says Axel Weselek , PhD candidate University Hohenheim , Germany , studied agrivoltaics benefit crops potatoes , wheat celeriac . In plain financial terms , 's often attractive invest simple photovoltaic installations nothing farming , Weselek says . `` Because , investor , n't care agricultural productivity – [ ] investment , '' says . Installing array around crops expensive non-standard design cost elevating panels ground . The electrical yields also lower fewer panels per unit area let sun reach plants underneath . It cost €1m ( $ 1.1m/£900,000 ) per 2.5 acres ( 10,000 sq ) Italy put agrivoltaic farm , according Lancellotta , 7 % traditional photovoltaic one . The initial investment substantial , expected return six seven years . According Lancellotta , today , farmers access kind capital . One option partner energy producers profit selling energy pay rent farmer also cultivates crops underneath panels . This , however , easy routine agricultural activities substantially reduce energy production , vice versa , invasive maintenance works panels damage crops . Cooperation good contracts key system work , Lancellotta says . On project , Lancellotta partnered EF Solare Italia , largest owner solar plants Italy . The firm owns panels top Lancellotta 's citruses farm Le Greenhouse , though Lancellotta family also . According Andrea Ghiselli , chief executive EF Solare Italia , way meet country 's demand renewable energy next decade agrivoltaics . Currently , 9 300 solar farms agrivoltaic . Still , says 50 % new installations elevated , become challenging set conventional solar farms Italy . CARBON COUNT The emissions travel took report story 30kg CO2 , travelling train . The digital emissions story estimated 1.2g 3.6g CO2 per page view . Find calculated figure . `` Can afford photovoltaic farms without agriculture Italy next years ? '' Ghiselli says . Since costs investors higher , believes governments write clear agrivoltaic farming guides regulations incentivise protect investors . This ongoing project . `` There regulatory framework certain , even great interest entrepreneurs , '' says Alessandra Scognamiglio , agrivoltaics researcher president Italian Association Sustainable Agrivoltaic . She currently working Italian government shape new regulatory framework . As walk rows trees , Lancellotta grabs citrus blossom hands eat : sweet , tangy flavour unfurls mouth . Around us , bumblebees harvest flower 's pollen goldfinches fly greenhouse . `` Agriculture activity carried land community lives , '' says Lancellotta . `` And therefore photovoltaics must considered perspective . It must designed community lives . '' -- Join one million Future fans liking us Facebook , follow us Twitter Instagram .
