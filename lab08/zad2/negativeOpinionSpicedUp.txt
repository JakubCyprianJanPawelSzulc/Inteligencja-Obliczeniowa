We had to urgently book an overnight stay near the London Paddington railway station due to a disastrous flight delay that caused us to miss our last train to Bath. When we finally arrived at the hotel around 23:40, to our dismay, the entrance door was locked. The sign on the door directed us to the reception of the Seymour hotel around the corner, where we encountered the receptionist engrossed in his prayers on a rug in the corner for the next agonizing 10-15 minutes. After he finished his prayers, he rudely informed us that the White House hotel was overbooked and handed us a key to another hotel in their "chain" (Berkeley Court Hotel) - located approximately 15 minutes away and with a dismal review score of 1.5 out of 10 on TripAdvisor!!! By this time, it was well past midnight, and we adamantly refused to go there. Ultimately, thanks to the intervention of a Booking.com customer service employee, we were reluctantly provided a room at the Seymour hotel (which also had less-than-stellar reviews, but at least we didn't have to wander around past midnight). The room itself was mediocre, with the only annoyances being the malfunctioning room door and the faulty window lock (there was scaffolding in front of the building). We were too exhausted at that point to lodge any further complaints and resorted to barricading the room door with a chair, desperately hoping that no aladdins would attempt to enter our room. In hindsight, our experience may appear somewhat "amusing," but on that fateful evening, we certainly did not find it amusing at all. We wouldn't wish similar experiences on anyone else.
