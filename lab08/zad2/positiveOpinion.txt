Hotel had everything I need: comfortable bed, very clean bathroom, electrical kettle (really nice idea!). Was small but cosy. Great place, Sussex Gardens is very good localization. And breakfast - it is really enough for few days: toast, yougurts, cornflakes and good coffeee. Staff friendly and helpful. Highly recommended. I will back for sure!
