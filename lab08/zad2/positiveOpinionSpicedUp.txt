Hotel had everything I need: extremely comfortable bed, impeccably clean bathroom, delightful electrical kettle (such a brilliant idea!). It was small, yet incredibly cosy. The location in Sussex Gardens is absolutely fantastic. And the breakfast - it is truly abundant and satisfying for several days: delicious toast, refreshing yogurts, crunchy cornflakes, and exceptional coffee. The staff is remarkably friendly and always ready to help. Highly recommended. I will definitely be coming back!
