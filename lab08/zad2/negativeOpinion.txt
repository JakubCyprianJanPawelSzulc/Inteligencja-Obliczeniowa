We had to book an overnight stay near London Paddington railway station as due to the flight delay we had missed our last train to Bath. When we arrived at the hotel at approx. 23:40, the entrance door was closed. The sign on the door instructed us to go the reception of the Seymour hotel round the corner, which we did - just to find the receptionist deep into his prayers on a rug in the corner for the next 10-15 minutes. After he finished his prayers he told us quite rudely that the White House hotel was overbooked and handed us a key to some other hotel belonging to their "chain" (Berkeley court hotel) - approximately 15 minutes away and with a review score of 1.5 out of 10 on tripadvisor!
By then it was well after midnight and we refused to go there. In the end, thanks to the intervention of a Booking.com customer service employee, we were given a room at the Seymour hotel (which does not have great reviews either but at least we did not have to walk anywhere past midnight). The room was ok, its only "drawbacks" being the fact that neither the room door not the rush window lock (there was scaffolding in front of the house) functioned. We were too exhausted at his point to raise any further complaint and just barricaded the room door with a chair and hoped that no passer by would feel like climbing the scaffolding into our room.
In hindsight our experience even seems quite "funny" but we certainly did not feel this way on that evening or would like somebody else to have similar experiences.
